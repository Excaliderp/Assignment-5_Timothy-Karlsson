HTML
//- have an index.html at root level for publishing on github pages
//- have multiple pages
//- have a Header, footer and navigational menu on all main pages (where possible)
//- Specific project pages (eg assignment 2) may have to open in a new window 
you don't want the user to be able to navigate away from your site
//- pay attention to SEO requirements regarding page titles 
//- include a mail to contact form similar to Assignment 1 with the user's name and a message added to the email body.
//- On submit the user's email client should open

CSS
//- have external CSS
//- have a general style sheet or sheets for common elements like header, footer and navigation
//- have a typography style sheet
//- have separate stylesheets for each page
//- be responsive (one breakpoint at 991px at the minimum)
//- include at least one locally installed font

JS
//- include a jQuery plugin (such as a carousel)
//- include a JS/jQuery multi level menu - the projects page is perfect for this. 
//At least 2 levels are required and it must be done with JS events

//- good project organisation - separate directories for all relevant files (html, css, fonts, images, js) - index.html is excluded
//- CSS variables 
//- CSS prefixing where required
- include jQuery effects like fade and slide - an example would be a read more button that displays content on click
