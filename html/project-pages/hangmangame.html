        <h3>A bit more advanced Hangman game. Made in jQuery, HTML and CSS.<br>(December, 2022)</h3>

          Third assignment during our frontend course. We were tasked with building a word game, this time connecting
          the javascript
          with the html.<br>
          Luckily, this assignment was given to us as we we're going through jQuery. So instead of having an assignment
          which would
          have been a mysterious ticking pipe bomb, it was a lot of fun.<br>
          Again i made the Hangman game, since I'm not very creative... Also a bit lazy. I did learn by my mistake
          thinking it would
          be easy, just tinkering with my already existing code and just adding it to html. It was not that easy, and I
          ended up
          rewriting all my code. Shame on me, but i learned a whole lot!
